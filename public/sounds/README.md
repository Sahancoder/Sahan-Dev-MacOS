# Sound Effects

To add macOS-style click sound:

1. Download a macOS click sound effect (free from sites like freesound.org or pixabay.com)
2. Convert it to MP3 format if needed
3. Name it `click.mp3`
4. Place it in this `/public/sounds/` directory

The sound will play automatically on button clicks throughout the mobile interface.

**Recommended:** Search for "macOS click sound" or "UI click sound" - keep it short (under 0.5 seconds) and subtle.

Alternative: You can record the actual macOS system click sound using QuickTime on a Mac.
